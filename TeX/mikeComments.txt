Ana,

Here are some comments on your humanoids paper:

- Overall, you have some very good content. However, you need to work on focusing on a single thesis and proving it throughout the paper. Also, I think the title could be less wordy and more informative ;0} -

- \dontprintsemicolong and \SetNoline don't let me compile it... something's missing or you have some kind of definitions that I don't. I was able to compile it after commenting them out

- You definitely need to do a thorough grammar/spelling check ont this. Get some folks to help you edit (Neil at least).

- What is your THESIS??? And where is it stated? Are you proving your thesis? Make sure that you have a clear thesis from the beginning and that your paper supports this thesis. Right now you have good content but its sort of all-over-the-place. You need to lead the reader through a proof of your thesis.

(You need to be saying something like this from the very beginning and proving it throughout the paper).

- From what I know of your work, you are introducing a \emph{resolution complete} algorithm for workspace trajectory tracking that searchers the robot nullspace. Your method is general to any number of degrees of freedom, making it particularly useful for humanoid robots. Furthermore it is computationally efficient, making it suitable for use in real-time. To our knowledge this is the first resolution complete algorithm for trajectory tracking in high-dimensional spaces.

- Your abstract is a bit too wordy and it doesn't actually statate what problem you are solving :0} Make it very clear what problem you're addressing (right now it sounds like you're solving IK)...

- What are "computability restrictions"? Are you trying to say something "constraints on computational complexity and processing time..." or something like that?

- You only introduce the problem in paragraph 4 of the introduction. It should be introduced from the beginning. Center everything around the problem and the thesis.

- This paper is being sent to Humanoids, so do spend a bit of time relating it to humanoids. Keep your approach general, but emphasize that it is particularly relevant to humanoids because they are highly redundant systems. You probably want to do that in the abstract, intro and conclusion.

- There needs to be an Analysis section that shows or proves that your algorithm is resolution complete! A proof is a convincing argument. You just need to convince the reader that in the limit your algorithm will explore all the options of joint-space motion and will return in finite time if no solution exists.

- I anticipate you will be adding the humanoid experiment etc.

- (DONE) Lose the acknowledgements for now

I hope I have another chance to look at this before I take off to Australia - but if not, I think the content is good and as long as the issues above are addressed, you should submit it.

Mike
